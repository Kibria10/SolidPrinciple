# SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym that stands for a set of five design principles used in object-oriented programming. These principles help developers create software that is easy to maintain and extend over time.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A class should have only one reason to change.
- A class should have only one responsibility.
- Avoid classes with too many methods or properties, as they may become difficult to maintain.
- Keep your code focused on a single concern.

## Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Avoid modifying existing code when adding new features.
- Instead, create new classes or modules that can be easily extended to support new functionality.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
- A subclass should be able to replace its parent class without causing errors.
- Avoid modifying base classes in a way that could break their subclasses.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Create small, focused interfaces that only include the methods that are needed by the client.
- Avoid creating large, monolithic interfaces that can become difficult to manage.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
- Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details.
- Details should depend on abstractions.

By following these principles, you can create code that is more flexible, maintainable, and easier to understand.
